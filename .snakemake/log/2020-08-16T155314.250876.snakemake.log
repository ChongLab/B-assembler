Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	select_longread
	1

rule select_longread:
    input: read_len_distrbution.txt
    output: read_len_distrbution1.txt
    jobid: 0

Error in rule select_longread:
    jobid: 0
    output: read_len_distrbution1.txt
    shell:
        cat read_len_distrbution.txt | soort -rn > read_len_distrbution1.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job select_longread since they might be corrupted:
read_len_distrbution1.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
